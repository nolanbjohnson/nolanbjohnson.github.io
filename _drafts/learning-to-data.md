Since I graduated from Arizona State University in 2009, Economics degree in hand, I have been on a path to learn how to work with data. At my first job, as an Economic Analyst at a local firm called Elliot D. Pollack & Co. (EDPCo), I learned to use Excel well, started learning how VBA could help me automate repetitive tasks (I hate repetitive tasks more than the average person), got some functional experience with databases and learned that not everyone was interested in innovating the way that I was.

This last fact was proven to me when, after working at EDPCo for about 8 months, I approached the CFO of the company with an innovative new approach to the way we produced our standard set of monthly stat tables. Given a consistent set of inputs, mostly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a consistent set of outputs, it seemed obvious to me that we could let computers do the hard work of connecting the dots, automating all the steps in between and saving hours of manual manipulation. To my surprise, the CFO was not interested in this newfangled approach and remarked that he "preferred to do it his way." In my naivety, I didn't realize that you __could__ choose between the obviously more efficient approach. I thought the better option won out by default. It took a few more years, and many opportunities to implement my innovative approaches (needless to say, at my next job), before I realized the unintended consequences that come with any change. I still believe that the CFOs aversion was due to ignorance and fear of the unknown, but my approach was no less ignorant of the difficulties of managing change.

As I mentioned, at EDPCo I got my first taste of learning to use a tool (Excel) well and fell in love with learning better and more efficient ways to solve a problem--a love that has been the most consistent thread throughout my career. Leaving EDPCo and Phoenix, AZ in my dust, I moved to Wisconsin to work for a software company called Epic. Epic was the polar opposite of EDPCo. Most of the workforce was young, for the majority it was their first job after college, and almost everyone was eager to find new and faster ways of doing things.
