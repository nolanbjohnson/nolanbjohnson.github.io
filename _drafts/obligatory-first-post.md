This will be a forum for my musings on a variety of topics--namely whatever suits me. So far as I can predict as of this writing it will mainly consist of my revelations as I attempt to learn more about data science and visualization, ideas I have about how to deal with data problem that I've picked up while hacking solutions mostly in Excel and other accessible tools, curating of things I read and learn, especially to help supplement my faulty memory, a smattering of personal stories perhaps and my others hobbies like carpen-trying, biking and ignorant (often late-night) philosophizing.
