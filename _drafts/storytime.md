I am currenlty in a state of flux--transitioning cities and jobs. When I decided to leave Madison, WI, my home of over 4 years, I was completely steeped in the largest project of my career. It was a database-driven project management tool that focused on end-users interacting with a pre-defined list of tasks and milestones, as well as the ability to add/edit them on the fly. On the scale of enterprise software, I'm sure this is a minor undertaking. Nonetheless, it involved certain complexities and allowed me to stretch as a designer. I'd like to share a few of the insights that helped make the project successful.

As I mentioned, I am currently transitioning jobs and hoping to move into a more technical role as a data scientist. Therefore I'm doing a lot more work in Python and learning how to perform machine learning analysis, etc., but before all of this I learned Excel. Excel is wonderful because it's A) programmable and B) ubiquitous. By programmable I am referring to both the ability to use the purely declarative/functional Excel envrionment as well as VBA to program features that would not be possible (or at least very difficult) to perform in the standard Excel environment.
